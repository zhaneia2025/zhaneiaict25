        <h2>Preschool</h2>
        <p>A Joyful Beginning
In preschool, my days were filled with laughter and exploration. Learning felt like play, and every day was an adventure. Learning in preschool was unlike anything I had experienced before. It felt less like formal education and more like an exciting adventure. I remember the thrill of our art projects, where we learned how to draw, color, and paint. I can still picture the feel of the crayons in my tiny hands, the way the colors danced on the paper as I scribbled with unrestrained enthusiasm. Every stroke of the crayon was a chance to express my feelings, to create something unique that was entirely mine.</p>

        <p>Discovering New Horizons
As I transitioned to elementary school, I eagerly discovered new subjects. Each lesson brought excitement, whether it was solving math problems or reading new books. I formed friendships that made those years memorable, deepening my love for learning.</p>

        <h2>Junior High</h2>
        <p>I faced a profound loss when my mother passed away. It was a difficult time that tested my resilience. I struggled with grief while trying to balance schoolwork, learning the importance of strength and seeking support from friends and teachers. Now in grade 10, I find the workload demanding, but I refuse to let it define me. Iâ€™m part of a special program in the arts, where I explore my passion for dance, allowing me to express my emotions and connect with others. I am also learning to be independent and strive for academic success.</p>
