        <h2>Parents</h2>
        <p> My mother, Janet G. Labonete, was a teacher who inspired many students with her passion for education. She passed away this year, leaving a significant void in our lives. She was my everything—my confidante and my shopping buddy. mommy is a kind hearted and always provide for our wants and needs. Her favorite color was light green, a reflection of her gentle spirit and nurturing nature.

My father, Zacarias Labonete, is a seaman, which speaks to his adventurous spirit and commitment to our family. Even when he is away at sea, he works hard to ensure that we have everything we need. Since my mother’s passing, he has taken on the role of both parents, embracing significant responsibilities with strength and dedication. His commitment to us is evident in how he manages to balance work and family life, always making time for us despite the challenges.</p>

        <h2>Siblings</h2>
        <p>I have four siblings, each with their own unique personalities and interests. The oldest, Jecca Aizziel Labonete, is tall and has a cheerful, chubby demeanor. She enjoys sleeping and spending time on TikTok, often sharing funny videos with us. Currently, she is a college student at ACC, juggling her studies with her hobbies. Next is Jezza Janelle Labonete, who is more introverted. Her favorite color is also green, and she finds joy in singing and watching TikTok videos. Is currently a Grade 11 STEM student at Antique National School, where she is dedicated to her studies while nurturing her creative side.
As the middle child, I often find myself in a balancing act between my siblings. I strive to support them while also navigating my own interests and responsibilities.
The fourth sibling, Zaijan Labonete, is a Grade 7 student at ACC. He shares a passion for performing arts, often singing and dancing around the house, bringing a lively energy to our family. His enthusiasm is contagious, and he has a natural talent for entertaining us.
Lastly, our youngest sibling, Zaiden Labonete, currently lives at our grandmother's house because his school is nearby. Despite being the youngest, he is a joyful kid with a vibrant personality. Zaiden loves playing online games, often sharing his gaming adventures with us. He is in Grade 5 at PIES, where he enjoys making new friends and learning new things.</p>
